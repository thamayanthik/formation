Array:
      Array is simple Data Structure where the elements are stored in sequence in memory means consecutive location.
      Array elements are accessed using index.

      There are 2 types arrays,

        1. Static Array
        2. Dynamic Array

        Static Array: It is fixed length array. It is not possible to add item more than size of the array

        Time Complexity:
                    Adding: O(n) [Array has to be resized if the already full, if it has space O(1)]
                    Getting Element from by Index : O(1)
                    Getting Element by Value : O(n)
                    Deleting Element to Array : O(n) [Find index of element and the remove the value]


        Dynamic Array: Arrays should grow and Shrink whenever new elements added/dropped;
                       There is no explicit option to define dynamic array in Java,
                       ArrayList (not synchronized) and Vector (synchronized) are java supported dynamic arrays.
                       These classes internally uses arrays to store elements.
                       These class has logic to grow and shrink whenever elements add/removed from List.
                       "The size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant time.
                       The add operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.
                       All of the other operations run in linear time (roughly speaking)"
